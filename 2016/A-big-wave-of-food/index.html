<p>Here are some outcomes:</p>
<h4 id="Baked_potatoes_(with_cheese)">Baked potatoes (with cheese)</h4><p>Cheese can be cooked with anything!<br>A old Chinese saying: Cheese is Power</p>

<h4 id="Braised_ribs">Braised ribs</h4><p>It tasted really sweet and juicy<br>Cooking that dishes require extraordinary patience and skill in stir frying</p>

<h4 id="Anpan">Anpan</h4><p>It’s my first trial in baking grain food. Without a blender, I knead the grain compound for a hour. While I can only gave it 7/10 point since a blender could knead the compound more completely.</p>

<h4 id="Fired_pho_with_eggs_and_vegetables">Fired pho with eggs and vegetables</h4><p>Simple as it looks, this food is the touchstone of one’s cooking skills. Because it requires not only the skill in temperature management (expecially difficult on a gas furnace) but also the skill in rolling pans, both of these skills are quite difficult for amateur.</p>
