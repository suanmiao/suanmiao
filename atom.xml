<h4 id="Background:">Background:</h4><ul>
<li>This was the first independent mobile game project for me. Before that, I learned Java and Android development by myself and developed several applications such as Android based calculator, Android based weather application.</li>
<li>This was also the first teamwork project for me. Its the first time that I found an appropriate product designer to collaborate with. We used Evernote to store our documents, used QQ to transfer sketches and icons.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Description">Description</h4><p>This is a Android based mobile game. Different from other games on Android platform, this game was developed without using existing game engine. I wanted to develop a basic, complete game engine myself, this would help me to understand mechanisms beneath the mobile game engine.</p>
<p>There were several features for this game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tower defense game with management on your different kinds of towers. Specially, towers of different kinds and different levels were upgraded from on basic tower, you could chose different direction for its upgrade</li>
<li>Map selection. You can chose different maps for your game.</li>
<li>Level and Mode selection. Three different level: easy, normal, hard. Two different modes: normal, infinity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Process">Process</h4><h5 id="1-Building_view_drawing_and_animation_system">1.Building view drawing and animation system</h5><p><strong> View Drawing system </strong></p>
<p>Although Android system provides API for me to draw images on the screen, images with excessive size should be processed before being drawn. Additionally, there were so many spites and items in one game, all of which might be added to current screen dynamically. So I had to design and implement a image management and drawing system.</p>
<p>According to basic components of a game, there were three kinds of images to be drawn:</p>
<ul>
<li>background image and relating items</li>
<li>spites(monsters and towers)</li>
<li>effects(flames, lights)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to manage them efficiently, I used tree structure to manage them:</p>
<p>There was one parent for all images, this parent had three sons, who were responsible for three kinds of images exclusively. Each sons contains all images under this category. For each image object, there several properties with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>visibility. Whether this image was visible, when it was transparent or out of screen, we could ignore them in order to increase efficiency.</li>
<li>scale. Each image was able to be scaled in order to show specific animations and movements.</li>
<li>position. Position for this image on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, they should be set into different layers:<br>background image and relating items should be drawn first, thus there were on the lowest level of the view hierarchy. spites were on the middle layer, effects were on the highest layer.</p>
<p>While drawing, my algorithm would travel the whole tree to manage each image.<br>I used DFS (depth first search) to travel all objects effectively. On the one hand, DFS is easier to be implemented than WFS (width first search), on the other hand, these two algorithms were in same efficiency under this condition.</p>
<p><strong> Animation </strong></p>
<p>Animations system was necessary if I wanted to display movements of monsters and towers. One method was using frame animation: draw pictures for each frame and display 20-30 frames in one seconds, then, due to special properties of our eyes, we would consider these discrete images as continuous animation.</p>
<p><strong>Animation resource</strong><br><img src="/img/herotower/animation.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p><strong>Explosion effects</strong><br><img src="/img/herotower/explosion_effects.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="2-Building_touch_event_management_system">2.Building touch event management system</h5><p>One advantage and useful user interface for Android smartphones was the touch screen. With this touch screen, uses were able to interact with phones through gestures such as click, long click and drag.</p>
<p>In our tower defense game, we used two touch gestures: click and drag. Users used click to chose specific options and they used drag to set specific position for each tower.</p>
<p>So, I should develop a touch event management system in order to manage user gestures effectively.</p>
<p>First, I should know which kinds of items on the screen were interactive:</p>
<ul>
<li>menu layouts. Before starting each game, users could config their games on menu layouts</li>
<li>towers and its relating options</li>
<li>monsters</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there were several properties related to each interactive items:</p>
<ul>
<li>position of the item</li>
<li>size of the item</li>
<li>whether it’s interactive</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like managing images, I also chose tree structure as the basic structure for touch event management system.</p>
<h5 id="3-Building_collision_detection_system">3.Building collision detection system</h5><p>In a tower defense game, bullets from towers should be able to interact with monsters and cause some effects on these monsters. So a collision detection system was necessary</p>
<p>Collisions between different items should be classified from their shapes. For example, detecting collisions between two round objects was quite easy, we should only judge the distance between centers of different round objects and compare these distances with their radius. However, detecting collisions for square objects were not so simple.</p>
<h5 id="4-Resource_management_system">4.Resource management system</h5><p>There were so many resources in one game that they could not be loaded into memory at once. In order to make use of limited memory space, I should manage these resources according to their usage and using frequency. Fortunately, there was one algorithm for this work: LRU (Lease recent used) caching algorithm. According to this algorithm, resources were arranged according to their using frequency and time of each use record.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/149493237" target="_blank" rel="external">SmartCar</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user36472250" target="_blank" rel="external">suanmiao</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Background:">Background:</h4><ul>
<li>Smart-car is widely used in many fields, including disaster rescue, outdoor investigation and entertainment industry. We intended to design a smart-car which could not only avoid obstacles and find target automatically, but also interact with people and be controlled by human in emergence situation.</li>
<li>Smartphone, a device with user-friendly user interface, strong computational power,  is a perfect medium to connect people with other devices. Additionally, most smartphones are equipped with Bluetooth interface. Thus, we can use smartphones as the connector between smart-car and human.</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Features">Features</h4><h5 id="1-_Avoid_obstacles">1. Avoid obstacles</h5><p>The smart-car was able to avoid obstacles from all directions automatically. This functionality was made possible by utilizing Ultrasound scanners and algorithms on the controller.</p>
<h5 id="2-_Search_for_fire">2. Search for fire</h5><p>In order to search for fire, we should find specific characteristics of fire and choose appropriate characteristics as the basis for our detection and algorithm.<br>After investigation, we found three characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature (heat)</li>
<li>visible light</li>
<li>infrared light</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there were several disadvantages of other two characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>temperature, heat spread with no linear direction, thus we could not detect the direction of fire from limited number of heat sensors</li>
<li>visible light,  although light emitted by fires are stronger than most other objects, there are still other objects such as lights and the sun that could emit strong lights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we chose infrared light as the basic characteristic we detect and measure to find the fire</p>
<h5 id="3-_Human_control">3. Human control</h5><p>In some emergence situation, such as the situation when car itself can not react as quickly as human controller, we human should take control of the car. So we developed smartphone based client to control smart-car.<br>On the client side, human controller is able to see the overall situation(speed, direction) of smart-car, and control its movement<br>This functionality was made possible by utilizing Android platform and Bluetooth interface of smartphones.</p>
<h4 id="Hardware_Components">Hardware Components</h4><p>In order to make our overall structure more flexible and reusable, we devised and implemented other four components separately and manage them through the center-algorithm on the center controller.</p>
<h5 id="1-_Center_Controller">1. Center Controller</h5><p>This component is responsible for managing other four components.<br>MSP430 controller, a 16 bits, super low energy consumption, RISC(Reduced instruction set computing) processor, is the major part of this component. This controller is able to connect and manage wireless component, motor component easily through its rich IO mouths. Additionally, applications could be transmitted and flashed into this controller through USB, thus the development process became efficient.</p>
<p><strong>MSP430 controller</strong><br><img src="/img/smartcar/center_controller.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="2-_Path_detection_component">2. Path detection component</h5><p>In order to avoid obstacles, we chose ultrasound as the basic measurement signal. ultrasound spreads linearly and when there are obstacles, certain amount of ultrasound of same frequency would be reflected back. Utilizing this mechanism, we devised corresponding algorithms on the controller.</p>
<h5 id="3-_Fire-detection_and_fire-put-out_component">3. Fire-detection and fire-put-out component</h5><p>As investigated in the first section, we chose infrared as the basic detection source. Thus ST188 infrared sensor was used by us to implement this functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared sensors</strong><br><img src="/img/smartcar/fire_detection.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Putting out a fire required strong wind from a big fan. Under this condition, we can not connect this component directly into the IO mouth of center controller but to design a specific current driver for this component. After investigation, we chose L298N, a efficient and cheap current driver to take this responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Fans and current controller</strong><br><img src="/img/smartcar/fans_and_controller.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="4-_Movement_component">4. Movement component</h5><p>This component included two functionalities: movement and speed-tracing.</p>
<p>For the movement function, we had to drive four DC motors at the same time, this requires on current could be met by L298 current driver.</p>
<p><img src="/img/smartcar/current_driver_motor.jpg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>In order to trace the real-time speed, we chose 74HC14 infrared component to implement this functionality.<br><strong>Speed tracing and tracing wheel</strong><br><img src="/img/smartcar/speed_tracing_and_tracing_wheel.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="5-_Communication_component">5. Communication component</h5><p>In order to communicate with smartphones through Bluetooth, we chose HC-06 Bluetooth component as the basic communication controller.</p>
<p><strong>Basic commands and signals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current speed</li>
<li>Current direction</li>
<li>Turn-Left command</li>
<li>Turn-Right command</li>
<li>Forward command</li>
<li>Backward command</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these basic signals, we could produce some more complicated commands such as forward-left and backward-right.</p>
<h4 id="Software_Client">Software Client</h4><p>Three functionalities were provided by software client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying current state. On the screen, users could see current speed and direction of the smart-car.</li>
<li>Movement control. Our client provided a gamepad-like experience to control the smart-car, users can control the direction, speed on the touchscreen with good user experience.</li>
<li>Function control. In order to switch between different modes in time of emergency, there were a panel for user to control the function of this smart car.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Team member:</strong> Hongkun Leng, Jialin Liang, Su Li</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Background:">Background:</h4><ul>
<li>The rapid development of IoT(Internet of Things)  influence our life impressively. Attracted by the ubiquitous trend, we were eager to take our part.</li>
<li>The rise of open source hardware, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank" rel="external">Raspberry PI</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" target="_blank" rel="external">Arduino</a> and other existing ARM, 51 platform, made the development of new IoT device easier and more powerful. Under this circumstance, we chose STC12 as the hardware platform and connected it with Android application through Bluetooth 4.0  </li>
<li>There had been some existing products. However they lacked some essential features such as video chat and voice chat, which we considered critical for a IoT toy.</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Components">Components</h4><h5 id="1-_Client_side">1. Client side</h5><p>The Android based application was responsible for video chatting and control of toys.<br>There were four functions of the client side</p>
<ul>
<li>Toys control. the application was able to control the strength, length and shaking mode of the toy through widgets on panel page.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/fun/control_page.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Square and Pair. In order to be paired with the right person, one could search on the “Square page” and pair with users he/she like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/fun/social_page.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Video chat. After paring with a specific user, they can connect with each other and video-chat with each other. The upper and bottom part of the screen were face of relatively current user and current connected user.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/fun/video_chat_page.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<ul>
<li>Remote control. Besides controlling their own toys, paired users could also control toys of each other through Socket Streaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to development these functions, I used these techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP Socket. Although no direct connection can be set under mobile network, we could connect clients indirectly through servers. TCP Socket was able to exchange  streaming data with servers. On Android platform, there was already existing Socket API for this technique, On Server side, there was Node.js Socket.io plugin to implement the same protocol.</li>
<li>Surface View. Displaying large quantity of images on mobile devices takes pretty much computing and  memory space resources. In order to reduce potential influence on mobile device, I chose “”SurfaceView” widget, which could handle data on multiple threads,  to display these images.</li>
<li>Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth was responsible for exchanging data between mobile and toys.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="2-_Hardware_component">2. Hardware component</h5><p>The hardware part was responsible for exchanging signals with mobile devices and driving toys. This part was consisted of three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth component. This component was responsible for exchanging signals with mobile devices. These signals were then sent to microchip.</li>
<li>STC 12 microchip. This was processing center of this hardware device. It was in charge of exchanging and processing signals from mobile devices, controlling the micro motor component.</li>
<li>Micro Motor. This component was responsible for driving toys with received electronic signal.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/fun/hardware_1.png" alt="Alt text"><br><img src="/img/fun/hardware_2.png" alt="Alt text"><br><img src="/img/fun/hardware_3.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="3-_Server_side">3. Server side</h5><p>On the server side, we used Node.js framework and Socket.io framework to provide real-time streaming functionality.<br>There were some advantages of this platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous operation. This feature made it possible for one server to exchange data with multiple clients at the same time with high efficiency.</li>
<li>Easy to deploy. All code could be modified and deployed within several lines of command.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="4-_Streaming_optimization">4. Streaming optimization</h5><p>Sending each complete frame on the stream is not a efficient strategy for video-chat. In order to reduce traffic pressure, we devised a streaming strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only send complete frame in the first connection, after that, only difference between two neighbor frames is sent.</li>
<li>In some case, when the connection is disrupted, and connected again, some differences would be lost. In order to maintain a stable streaming, we recorded time stamp for each frame, and compare the time stamp between two neighbor frames. If there the difference between two time stamps is bigger than threshold, a signal will be sent. And the server will send a complete frame.</li>
<li>Data is compressed in gzip format in order to make efficient transmission.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Background:">Background:</h4><p>Originally(before May 2015), there was no official mobile application for WeChat account management, the only approach was official website, which only worked properly on desktop. However, most frequently behavior, message view and reply, happens randomly. So there was a high demand for account management features on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Webpage for Wechat official account management</p>
<p><img src="/img/weclient/Before_login.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h4 id="Process">Process</h4><h5 id="1-Developed_login_simulating_framework">1.Developed login simulating framework</h5><p> In order to implement management features on mobile, we had to get necessary data for each operation, while there was no official API for us to execute such operation. So the only way was simulating HTTP request as it was on the webpage.</p>
<p>  For every HTTP request, there were some fundamental elements we had to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target server URL</li>
<li>Request Method(POST, GET, DELETE)</li>
<li>Method Parameters</li>
<li>Necessary Header parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>To get these elements, I used Chrome Developer Console, a perfect tool for web developer, on which we could get intercept and analyze elements for each HTTP requests<br><img src="/img/weclient/General Info.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>There were some basic techniques relating to simulating requests</p>
<ul>
<li>MD5 encryption (official encryption for password transmission and storage is MD5, a widely used encryption)</li>
<li>Cookie management, parse Cookie, store Cookie, read Cookie</li>
</ul>
<p>After simulating necessary requests, we could get the same HTML code as webpage version. Then, we had to parse HTML structure of the result and get what we need.<br>For example:<br>  <img src="/img/weclient/Result.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="2-Developed_Message_magement_function">2.Developed Message magement function</h5><p>After simulating necessary functions, the second step was to implement features. The most frequently used feature for Wechat account owners was message management. Due to the random distribution of fans(people who followed this account), message were received randomly, so account users have to wait in front of their desktop if there was no mobile application.  </p>
<p>After simulating functions,  the message data we got:</p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">"msg_item"</span>:[&#123;<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">401082279</span>,<span class="string">"type"</span>:<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="string">"fakeid"</span>:<span class="string">"355421075"</span>,<span class="string">"nick_name"</span>:<span class="string">"蒜苗白菜"</span>,<span class="string">"date_time"</span>:<span class="number">1449148933</span>,<span class="string">"source"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"msg_status"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"has_reply"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"refuse_reason"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"multi_item"</span>:[],<span class="string">"to_uin"</span>:<span class="number">2390625095</span>&#125;,</span><br><span class="line">&#123;<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">401082278</span>,<span class="string">"type"</span>:<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="string">"fakeid"</span>:<span class="string">"355421075"</span>,<span class="string">"nick_name"</span>:<span class="string">"蒜苗白菜"</span>,<span class="string">"date_time"</span>:<span class="number">1449148925</span>,<span class="string">"source"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"msg_status"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"has_reply"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"refuse_reason"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"multi_item"</span>:[],<span class="string">"to_uin"</span>:<span class="number">2390625095</span>&#125;,</span><br><span class="line">&#123;<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">401082277</span>,<span class="string">"type"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"fakeid"</span>:<span class="string">"355421075"</span>,<span class="string">"nick_name"</span>:<span class="string">"蒜苗白菜"</span>,<span class="string">"date_time"</span>:<span class="number">1449148906</span>,<span class="string">"content"</span>:<span class="string">"Test message two "</span>,<span class="string">"source"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"msg_status"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"has_reply"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"refuse_reason"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"multi_item"</span>:[],<span class="string">"to_uin"</span>:<span class="number">2390625095</span>&#125;,</span><br><span class="line">&#123;<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">401082275</span>,<span class="string">"type"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"fakeid"</span>:<span class="string">"355421075"</span>,<span class="string">"nick_name"</span>:<span class="string">"蒜苗白菜"</span>,<span class="string">"date_time"</span>:<span class="number">1449148900</span>,<span class="string">"content"</span>:<span class="string">"Test message one "</span>,<span class="string">"source"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"msg_status"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"has_reply"</span>:<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="string">"refuse_reason"</span>:<span class="string">""</span>,<span class="string">"multi_item"</span>:[],<span class="string">"to_uin"</span>:<span class="number">2390625095</span>&#125;]&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Obviously, this set of data was in JSON format, and we could serialize it into corresponding JSON object list.</p>
<p>There were some basic element in each “Message Object”</p>
<ul>
<li>id: the unique identify number for each message</li>
<li>fakeid: the id of user who send this message</li>
<li>nick_name: nick name for the sending user</li>
<li>to_uin: the id of official account to whom this message is sending</li>
<li>content: content of this message</li>
<li>date_time: time when this message was created</li>
</ul>
<p>After analyse, we found some relating features and their HTTP request URL</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>get message</strong>:    <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/message" target="_blank" rel="external">https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/message</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Finally, we implemented these features on mobile with user-friendly user interface</p>
<p>Relating techniques</p>
<ul>
<li>ListView, ViewPager Widget</li>
<li>MVVM software architectural pattern</li>
<li>Media Player component</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/weclient/message_list_1.jpeg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>For better user experience, We even developed an one-to-one chat page for each conversation</p>
<p><img src="/img/weclient/message_chat.jpeg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="3-Developed_Fans_management_function">3.Developed Fans management function</h5><p>In the same way, we parsed and clipped result for fans list</p>

<p>Then we displayed these data in an user-friendly UI</p>
<p>Relating technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dialog component</li>
<li>Popup Window component</li>
<li>Bitmap decoding</li>
<li>Fast cache</li>

<p>Fans alias editing feature:</p>
<p><img src="/img/weclient/edit_fans_alias.jpeg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="4-Notification_function">4.Notification function</h5><p>Taking full advantage of mobile platform, we used Notification API on Android system to alert users when there was new message while the app is running on background.</p>
<p>Relating technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notification API</li>
<li>Service component</li>
<li>Activity task mode</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="5-Open_Source">5.Open Source</h5><p>Although this was a fully functional application, it was still unofficial, we gained no support or authority from Wechat Platform, and we were only students whose credibility are limited. So, in order to show our honesty and enhance our credibility, we decided to publish our source code onto Github. The project page link: <a href="https://github.com/suanmiao/weclient" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/suanmiao/weclient</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By now, without any promotion and advertisement, this opensource project has been starred by 130 developers and forked by 50 developers.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really exciting and inspiring was this experience. It’s the first time that I fully take part in opensource community and firmly feel the super magic power of community, the influence of individuals can be amplified by the opensource community.</p>
<h4 id="Contribution">Contribution</h4><p>Without doubt, our app, as the first mobile app for account management, free account managers from desktop and they can  reply, edit message at any time. Besides that, we were also among rare developers who can release their project as opensource and be open to any advice and feedback. Consequently, we get 130 stars half a year after our release on Github.</p>
<h4 id="Milestone:">Milestone:</h4><ul>
<li>2013.12 —— Open Source project published</li>
<li>2013.12 —— First public beta version released (although there were some usability problems, we were consistently working on it)</li>
<li>2014.01 —— 500 users. This time we add feedback feature on app, and the first feedback from users was praise!</li>

<h4 id="Background:">Background:</h4><ul>
<li>Global rapid development of mobile devices, both in quantity and capability, makes smartphones ubiquitous in our life. Under this circumstance, smartphones become increasingly important for people’s daily life</li>
<li>On the other hand, diverse mobile applications on mobile phone support real-time communication services(e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, WeChat), these applications consume more and more energy, make battery life shorter and shorter</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Process">Process</h4><h5 id="1-(Problem_Locating)_Where_does_our_battery_gone?">1.(Problem Locating) Where does our battery gone?</h5><p>After monitoring on energy consumption, we found the energy consumption distribution for a daily use of smartphone like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/energy_consumption_distribution.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>From the distribution we found that Network interface took up large part of total energy. And most of “Network Energy” was consumed by Cellular network. Under close inspection, we found “Tail energy” phenomenon in network transmission. After data transmission, the network interface in cellphone would linger in high power state for about 10 seconds. Energy consumption in this period was called “Tail energy”, which took large part in network energy.</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/power_state.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>In order to figure out the cause of “Tail energy” in smartphone, we conducted a measurement on smartphone and found that power consumption on heartbeat transmission, a mechanism for instant message applications to keep in touch with servers, was the major cause of energy consumption( takes up about 87% of total transmission energy).</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/heartbeat_energy_consumption.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Besides that, heartbeat transmission periods for different applications were different, thus transmission happened randomly and “tail time” distribute randomly. In order to reduce “tail time”, we manage different heartbeat and data transmissions.  </p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/heartbeat_distribution.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="2-(Models_Formulation)_How_to_manage_packets?">2.(Models Formulation) How to manage packets?</h5><p>Firstly, we identify the tail energy for each package as follow:<br>(Denote pI, pD, and pF as power levels of the IDLE, DCH and FACH states)</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/tail_energy_formulation.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Secondly, there would be delay for data packets if we manage their transmission. And for different data packets, there were different extent of tolerance for delay. Then, we can formulate delay cost model as follow:<br>(suppose a packet u arrives at time ta(u), then the additional delay incurred is delay = ts(u) − ta(u). Size(u) denotes the size of packet u, B(u) denotes the average bandwidth received by u and tl(u) = size(u)/B(u) is the corresponding transmission time. Weighting coefficient wi reflects the user’s preference on the application i that generates u. The profile function fi(delay) characterizes how the performance degrades with the increase of delay.)</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/delay_cost_model.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Thirdly, a efficient management calls for a proper strategy. Taking tolerance, packet size, transmission efficiency, user experience into account, we devised transmission strategy as follow(sure, there was a long and tough procedure before we devised this strategy):</p>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/transmission_strategy.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="3-_System_Implementation">3. System Implementation</h5><p>Our transmission management system consisted of three components: Heartbeat Monitor, eTrain Scheduler and eTrain Broadcast</p>
<ul>
<li>Heartbeat Monitor was responsible for monitoring heartbeat behaviors of each application and inform other components if there was a heartbeat behavior.</li>
<li>eTrain Scheduler was responsible for storage,  delay and transmission of data packets. After some calculation, this component will chose specific data packets from waiting queue and send them.</li>
<li>eTrain Broadcast component was the connection between Heartbeat Monitor and eTrain Scheduler. Because heartbeat monitoring and data scheduling behaviors happen in different system process, there should be a system-level communication between these components.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/etrain/system_overview.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<h5 id="4-Evaluation">4.Evaluation</h5><p>Taking real world usage into account, we recorded user behaviors in three major application, email, Weibo(Chinese Twitter), and cloud storage app. The real world trace took place in cellular networks, 2-hours in campus.</p>
<p>Then, we synthesized similar data packets in laboratory and simulate previous user behaviors on a same smartphone, which was monitored by power monitor.</p>
<p>In order to make convincing comparison, we chose two relating models, PerES, eTime, as reference.</p>
<p>Results were as follow, our system could save 12%-30% of total energy. The efficiency depended on delay of data packets.</p>

<p>For users who use mobile for different period of time, the energy saving effect would also diverse. More active the user, more obvious the effect.</p>

<h4 id="Contribution">Contribution</h4><p>We were the first to prove the feasibility and efficiency of managing heartbeat packets, and the effect was remarkable. More surprisingly, same mechanism was used in Project Doze of Android system by Google.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>对于现代生活我一直心存疑问，没有了邻里街坊的社群关系，在这样一个满是水泥盒子的空间里，每天都面对从来没有见过也可能再也见不到的各式各样的人，生活在这里的人们怎样找回归属感，怎样找到伴随自己长大的那股人与人之间亲切的感觉，《深夜食堂》给了我答案，即便是在一个人群快速流动的空间里，通过这样一种形式将人们聚集起来，通过食物以及食物深深勾连的经历，人们能够打开心扉，靠得更近。</p>
<p><strong>1.包容</strong></p>
<p>本来打算将”故事”放到第一位，但我发现“包容”是支撑在“故事”背后更为重要的一股力量。食堂的食客里有警察，好色的大叔，有妓女，脱衣舞娘，同志，骗子，小职员，盘踞在本地的黑帮 ，还有形形色色的暂时居住在附近的人们，甚至连深夜食堂的店主也一定是个有过非常坎坷经历的人，到最后也没能得知他眼眶上的刀疤背后的故事。这样一个充满矛盾的群体能够相安无事已经是一个非常需要包容的事情。从剧情的发展也可以看出，食堂老板在面对食客们的各种坎坷或是尖锐的经历时表现出超常的淡定，淡定之后用他独特的平和方式帮助食客们渡过生活中或大或小的坎坷，也同食客们一起分享困难被克服之后的喜悦。记忆犹新的是，爱吃“中华冷面”的中年男子的行踪被在食堂吃饭的警察发现后，警察在食堂里的深入讨论和行动被食堂老板严厉制止，“我不希望这样的事情在食堂发生”，我想这是他当时的潜台词。作为一个带着各色故事或是罪名的人们能够暂时放下生活的负担分享自己的不顺和快乐的空间，食堂老板要做的正是维护这样一份包容和祥和，“包容”才是维系食客和食客以及食客与食堂老板间关系的最重要纽带。柜台前拿起筷子的每个人在这样一个空间里就变成了最单纯天真的人，“我要开动了”，“真好吃”，食客们或是赞叹或是大笑或是直接表现对某人的爱慕或是好色，内心最真实最单纯的感觉被释放出来。也只有在这样一个包容的环境里。</p>
<p><strong>2.故事</strong></p>
<p>《食堂》的每一集都是故事。每次都沉默在角落里摆弄着花生和鸡蛋壳的文艺青年竟然曾经是黑社会群体的头目；风韵犹存的老奶奶当年竟然是风靡圈内的脱衣舞娘；偶然路过的中年妇女曾经是当年娱乐界的当红歌手；食堂里的每个食客都带着自己的故事走进食堂，食堂老板和其他食客是平静的倾听者和热心的安抚者，埋藏在食客经历中的故事在这里被诉说或是挖掘出来，旧的故事被分享，新的经历沉淀成为故事。故事像是四处飘散的酵母，弥散在整个食堂里，将走进食堂的食客慢慢软化，勾连出每个食客自己的故事。</p>
<p>我出生的这座城市</p>
<p>是由钢筋水泥筑成</p>
<p>从旁边的工厂传来机器的轰鸣</p>
<p>而我呢总是昏昏沉沉</p>
<p>想要绕点远路再回去的夜晚</p>
<p>只会眺望天空</p>
<p>听不到鸟的歌声</p>
<p>有的只是机器的轰鸣</p>
<p>这样的城市就是我的故乡</p>
<p>所有的经历都是我珍爱的回忆</p>
<p>这样的城市就是我的故乡</p>
<p>机器的轰鸣身是令人怀念的奏鸣曲</p>
<p>比起令人伤感的夕阳</p>
<p>更想看让人充满希望的朝阳</p>
<p>所以请再给我一点追逐梦想的信心</p>
<p>为了迎接明天</p>
<p>若能对我微笑  若能对我微笑</p>
<p>如果我们能相视而笑</p>
<p>我会紧握你冰冷的手</p>
<p>轻轻地撒个慌</p>
<p>虽然今天我们也对别人说了谎</p>
<p>但是有一件事无法说谎</p>
<p>那就是我爱你</p>
