After 1.5 month in Mesosphere, contributing some code to the project, it’s necessary to connect both the general flow and code logic together.</p>
<h3 id="Background">Background</h3><p><strong>Mesos Architecture</strong></p>
<p>There has been a pretty well <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/architecture/">explanation</a> of different roles and relationships between these important components in Mesos. </p>
<p>In brief, we have several important concepts: Master, Agent/Slave, Framework (consisting of Scheduler and Executor). Master and Agent nodes are physical or virtual machines in datacenter. Master node is responsible for scheduling tasks (this “task” is our general understanding of task, meaning “a specific work to do, such as running a Spark job”, which is different from the definition of “task” in Mesos project), Agent node is responsible for running task. In order to scheduler and execute tasks in this distributed system, it’s necessary to have corresponding parts on both Master and Agent doing scheduling and executing work respectively. We call it Framework as a whole. The part that’s working on the Master node is called scheduler, the other part working on the Agent node is called executor. From this perspective, it’s pretty easy to understand how do these two names come from.</p>
<p>Since there might be multiple kind of tasks to run, we sometimes need to run multiple Frameworks (thus multiple schedulers, executors components) on Mesos, thus on the Master node, there might multiple schedulers, on Agent node, there might be multiple executors.</p>

The main motivation for this blog is to record some core concept and design choice of convolutional neural work. Although today’s neural network has much similar structure (conv, fc, dropout, lrn ..etc.). Much of these design choices are tried and tested by many generations of researchers. I was strongly wondering about these choice, so when I first implement the AlexNet, I stoped in the second line and decided to figure out reasons for these choices.</p>

<li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are biologically-inspired variants of MLPs.</li>
<li>Two basic cell types have been identified: Simple cells respond maximally to specific edge-like patterns within their receptive field. Complex cells have larger receptive fields and are locally invariant to the exact position of the pattern.</div><a href="/2017/Intro-to-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Personal-Notes/" class="read-more">... more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/Classic-Nets-LeNet-Analysis/" class="post-title-link">Classic Nets & LeNet Analysis</a></h2><div class="post-meta"><div class="post-time">Jan 23, 2017</div></div><div class="post-content"><p>This is one of the very first convolutional neural networks, many of the important concepts origin from this paper. It discussed through the whole process of abstracting digit recognition problem, choosing machine learning method, utilizing back propagation, analysis and utilizing convolutional neural network and finally construct the network.</p>
<p>The LeNet5 architecture was fundamental because of several core concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>image features are distributed across the entire image</li>
<li>convolutions with learnable parameters are an effective way to extract similar features at multiple location with few parameters</li>
<li>This is in contrast to using each pixel as a separate input of a large multi-layer neural network. LeNet5 explained that those should not be used in the first layer, because images are highly spatially correlated, and using individual pixel of the image as separate input features would not take advantage of these correlations.</li>

Amazingly, the accuracy of Alexnet exceeds previous record by large scale (16.4% top-5 error rate compared to 26.2% in previous record). Driven by the convolutional neural network, there are huge advantages over mannual-implemented filters/classifiers. While there are still some challenges such as the selection of activation functions, overcoming overfitting. Below are my brief note about the analysis of AlexNet: the structure and techniques utilized by the neural network.</p>
