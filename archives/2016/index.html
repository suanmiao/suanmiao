<p>For one thing, excessive information has been one of the most wide-spread and significant problem people are faced with.</p>
<p>For the other, I am a person who care much about efficiency. With a limited amount time, we can not extend the whole length of our time but to make the best use of useful time.</p>
<p>What’s more, reading is an important habit in my daily life. (Although it was always sacrificed for other insignificant things)</p>
<p>Get back to the point.</p>
<p>What should a efficient-reading app looks like?</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are two important rules/goals for us to follow when we are designing such a application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient information organization. (For instance, important/highly-used information should be displayed in high priority)</li>
<li>Abundant, clear, fast user interactions. (For instance, a key should appear when and only when I am in front of a door)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my solution for one simple case: news reading.<br>This app was originally designed for a RSS reading application, while I did not have enough time to finish the development. But I think some ideas behind this design is important and inspiring for design in other application.</p>
<h4 id="Overview">Overview</h4><p>This app is made up of only two main pages: article list page and article content page (I also call it “article consumption page”)</p>

<p>The most important thing: I found myself a cooking talent!</p>
<p>Last month, my trial in western dishes was pretty successful (although these dishes are quite basic). This time, I experimented some dishes with more skills, such as the control of temperature, degree of salt, and the use of pot (rolling and shifting).</p>
<p>Here are some outcomes:</p>

On a broad side, “mobile industry” include not only mobile phones but also wearable devices such as Google glasses/Holo Lens and VR devices. I care not only about current problems facing the industry such as energy consumption, excessive information overload, but also the future development of this industry: The ultimate form of mobile, I think, is a wearable “Personal Assistant”, an adaptable, open platform which could help people handle daily tasks and information. We are not talking about imagination or scenes in some movies, but an appropriate deduction from current trends, and there have been some trials towards this direction:</p></div><a href="/2016/Thoughts-into-Future-of-Mobile/" class="read-more">... more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/Zero To One/" class="post-title-link">Zero To One</a></h2><div class="post-meta"><div class="post-time">Jan 3, 2016</div></div><div class="post-content"><h4 id="Preface">Preface</h4><p>A book about how to build companies that create new things</p>
